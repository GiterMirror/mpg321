mpg321 (0.2.11-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Now mpg321 displays the right MPEG version. (Closes: Bug#197726).
  * New function added for restoring the correct xterm title.
  * New troubleshooting information added for the resources that mpg321
    uses for xterm control.
  * Bug #182122 should close now because in this version of Debian we don't
    face such problems. So I am closing this bug. (Closes: Bug#182122).
  * Man page now includes the new "-l" option. (Closes: Bug#575836).
    Thanks to Memnon Anon.
  * Tried to reproduce the same experiment as Bug #388587 and 
    I don't see any problem.
    If someone else can simulate the same problem, please report the bug
    and the way to simulate it again.So I am closing this bug also.
    (Closes: Bug#388587)
  * Anyone who wants to use the "-a" option can follow the information from 
    the manpage. To give an example: "mpg321 -a /dev/dsp song.mp3".
    So Bug #286176 should close.The "-a" option seems to work fine.
    (Closes: Bug#286176).
  * Properly added DM-Upload-Allowed: yes to source section of control file.
  * Adjusted watch file properly to eliminate errors of uscan.
  * Bumped debhelper versioned Build-Depends to 7, and updated
    debian/compat.
  * Bumped libao-dev versioned Build-Depends to 1.0.0.
  * Fixed libao-dev problem with the new structure option
    in ao_format_sample structure. In a near future version
    mpg321 will utilise the power of this new libao option.
    (Closes: Bug#580062, Bug#580193)

  * The "Not quite 0.3.0 but damn it, Debian is releasing soon" release.
  * Integrate patch from Luc Saillard starting the work on enabling Shoutcast
    streams. We now recognise shoutcast streams!  Closes: Bug#116385
  * Make reading MPEG data from a file descriptor work properly now.
    We weren't preserving the incomplete frame that MAD passed back to us,
    and this caused seams. This fixes the problems people were having with
    gtoaster. Closes: Bug#123537, Bug#124358
  * Fix EOF-detection on file descriptor streams. Closes: Bug#124360

mpg321 (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed ao.m4. It makes it more difficult to do aclocal on non-debian
    systems, but that's why I ship aclocal.m4.
  * Remove check for libintl.h in configure.ac; remove ifdef on libintl.h
    in getopt.c. Was causing build failures on systems which didn't have
    gettext integrated into the C library (i.e., anything but Linux)
  * Added check for *env; in ao.c, use putenv by default, unless it doesn't
    exist, in which case we use setenv, if it exists. If none of these exist
    we just don't try to use them.
  * Added support for forced stereo output, --stereo. Closes: Bug#119660.
  * Fixed non-printing of @ status in remote control mode in certain
    situations.
  * Fixed segfault when using test mode. Note that libao prints an ugly
    debugging message when test mode is being used, but that's already
    been fixed upstream. Closes: Bug#119523.
  * Made all mp3s play to their actual end, even if we don't print status
    information for that tail end. Closes: Bug#119661.
  * Recompile with new libmad, which has good shlibs. Closes: Bug#118009.
  * Switch back to automake 1.4, the Sane Choice.
  * Update build dependencies for libmad0-dev.
  * Apply patch from Martijn Vernooij to implement line buffering in
    Remote Control mode. This means that you no longer have to wait for
    a reply to your command to enter another.
  * Various correctness fixes wrt mpg123 emulation.

  * Made output when files with no path in the filename were printed
    conform to mpg123 (print a newline after mpg123 blurb)
    (Closes: Bug#114136)
  * Made remote control (-R) print only the filename, minus the extension
    (if one exists), as documented
  * Made mpg321 continue if there was a playlist specified but no
    files on the command-line (Closes: Bug#113294)
  * Concatenated the directory specified for the playlist with the files
    within the playlist itself, as long as the file wasn't specified with
    an absolute path
  * Added and changed header inclusion for BSDs - Patch by Christian Weisgerber
  * Changed calc_length to use unbuffered I/O only; buffered/unbuffered mix
    is undefined on some libcs - Patch by Christian Weisgerber
  * Initialized remote control file in playlist structure on creation -
    caused a segfault on FreeBSD/Alpha. Thanks for all of these, Christian!
  * Changed the string "single-channel" to "mono" in regular output, to
    conform with mpg123.
  * Rewrote README file
  * Added --skip-printing-frames= option, to limit output verbosity
  * Made playing multiple files with different numbers of channels or
    play rates work properly
  * Now using a new, experimental, extremely high quality dithering routine
    from the ever-brilliant Rob Leslie. Sound quality from mpg321 has
    never been better.

    Also by Stan Seibert and Eduward Bloch. I'm very impressed!
  * Added compile-time default audio device setting (--with-default-audio=)
  * Added aRts support
  * Enhanced run-time audio device to allow mpg321 to switch easily between
    esd, aRts, oss, alsa, and sun-style audio output
  * made -o h, -o l, -o s no-ops again, rather than emitting error messages.
  * Fixed volume not getting adjusted on mono streams
  * Made usage come up if you use options but specify no files/streams
  * Made mpg321 stop immediately if it can't open a file, like mpg123
  * Made Directory: only show for files which have a path in the filename.
  * Renamed short equiv for --aggressive to -I (Closes: Bug#112451)
  * Eduard Bloch implemented --aggressive - Thanks, Eduard!
  * Added support for playlists to use stdin (-@ -) (Closes: Bug#111499)
  * Made mpg321 compile cleanly with -Wall
  * Added -R (remote control) support. This took a lot of effort - it had
    better work. Please test with frontends and report bugs!

mpg321 (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the install hook which installs a symlink to mpg123 from mpg321
    to work properly. This only affects non-Debian systems, compiling from
    source.
  * Updated libao detection m4 macro. This provides better support for
    platforms like freebsd which require no dl library to dlopen().
    Also updated makefiles, etc, to distribute new m4 directory.

    (playlists, random play, and shuffle play) (Closes: Bug#95861)
    Thanks to Tobias Bengtsson for creating the first version of playlist
    support for mpg321.
  * Added creation of symlink to mpg123 on install (non-debian systems;
    debian uses alternatives). This won't overwrite an existing file 'mpg123'
    in your binary directory, though.
  * Ported to libmad; mpg321 also now uses libao exclusively for output.
    You can use -o alsa or -o esd to specify a different type of output
    device in addition to the -a to specify the specific device.
    Closes: Bug#94290, Bug#98772
  * This release is no longer dependent on libsdl. People who installed sdl
    because of the dependency, please see the package deborphan.

  * Fixed dumb no-ops with arguments that I missed
  * Made mpg321 depend on SDL 1.1.8 at least, in order to remove the hackish
    way of supporting devfs
  * Ensured documentation for all currently implemented commands
  * Define _GNU_SOURCE. mpg321 will have to be ported to other libc's that
    don't support the GNU extensions, I'm afraid (asprintf, getopt_long)
  * Implemented getopt option handling (Closes: Bug#85321)
  * Added smpeg patch to tarball, until Sam gets un-busy with Tribes 2 and
    releases a new version of smpeg with it integrated
  * Implemented SIGINT handling (Closes: Bug#85320)
    May also fix 85316, but I want to make sure on that.
  * Fixed mpg123 boilerplate to print only once a session
  * Added mpg123 slave alternative for manpage (Closes: Bug#89153)
    Arthur, if you haven't already, please file similar bugs on mpg123, etc.
  * Removed extraneous dh_testversion and other debhelper commands we don't
    need
  * This release has been used with gtoaster to burn audio cds. It seems all
