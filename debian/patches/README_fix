 unimplemented features, and undoubtedly still bugs. But it works well
 for many people, and it liberates one more dependency people had on
 non-Free software. That's worth it, to me.

+TROUBLESHOOTING
+---------------
+
+1) If mpg321 gives:
+	"libao - OSS cannot set rate to 44100" or/and
+	"Can't find a suitable libao driver. (Is device in use?)"
+   a) Try apt-get install libsamplerate0
+   b) Is alsa's OSS emulation loaded? Try: 
+   	"apt-get install alsa-oss"
+   	"modprobe snd_pcm_oss"
+	"modprobe snd_mixer_oss" as root.
+
+2) mpg321 has one resource, allowTitleOps, that enables or disables
+   special operations which mpg321 relies on. If any of these resources are
+   set(or defaults) to false mpg321 may hang. The resources corresponds to mpg321
+   options as:
+
+   allowTitleOps:
+   	--title
+   
+   To set this resource value persistenly you can add the following to either your
+   local ~/.Xdefaults file, or to system-wide resource file like
+   /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm:
+
+   *VT100.allowTitleOps: true
