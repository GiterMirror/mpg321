mpg321 was written by Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>, and based upon 'plaympeg'
from the smpeg sources, which was written by various people from Loki Software 
(http://www.lokigames.com).

It also incorporates some source from mad, written by Robert Leslie, and
SDL, by Sam Lantinga.

Tobias Bengtsson <tobbe@tobbe.nu> is the original author of the playlist
code.

Eduard Bloch <edi@gmx.de> and Stan Seibert <volsung@asu.edu>, among many
others, submitted patches to convert mpg321 to use the libao 0.8.0 api.

Giuseppe Corbelli <cowo@lugbs.linux.it> wrote the ID3 tag handling code.

Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com> has contributed several patches to
mpg321.

Stephen Depooter <sbdep@woot.net> has contributed to managing patches and
bug fixing to get the latest release out.
