If you want to help, please read the 'TODO' file. There are lots of things
people can do, from optimizing mpg321 and MAD for speed to writing up a
webpage. I welcome any and all comments, too - e-mail me! (hoserhead@woot.net)

Various helpful notes:
* I use 4 spaces for indentation, not tab. Please respect that, and my other
  source formatting.
* Use C-style comments only (/* ... */) - there are compilers which don't
  handle the C++-style comments (// ..)
* libmad's data always needs to be switched to local endianness; this is
  equivalent to it always returning little-endian data, but I've been told
  that's not so.
* The man page is generated by docbook-to-man from mpg321.sgml. 
* If you want to modify the configure.in, you'll need autoconf 2.50.
* There are a number of configure #defines which I don't do anything with.
  I'd appreciate it if you'd test mpg321 on different types of machines 
  (OSes, etc) and see what's needed and what's not in the source.
