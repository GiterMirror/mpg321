Version 0.2.11. This is a bug fix and patch inclusion release put together 
by Stephen Depooter and Chris Nanakos. This version supports basic proxy server
authentication, xterm title setting and much more from the TODO-list.
We still plan for the 0.3.0 release.

Version 0.2.11. This is a bug fix and patch inclusion release put together
by Stephen Depooter.  This version adds ipv6 support, basic support for 
winamp style playlists, and tries to fix up a number of other assorted bugs
that have been found. since the last release.  We still plan to for 
version 0.3.0 to be a 'network-ready' release.

2001-11-30:
Version 0.2.3. Hopefully have finally worked out all the bugs needed
for release with Debian 3.0, woody. Notable new features are the --stereo
option, for forcing stereo output, and buffered input on the remote control
interface.

2001-10-13:
Version 0.2.1. Futher bugfixing and polishing of documentation, for
release with Debian woody.
mpg321 now has a sourceforge project! See 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg321 .
There is also now a mailing list for mpg321 announcements: 
To subscribe, send an email with 'subscribe' in the body or subject to 
mpg321-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net, or visit

2001-09-23:
Version 0.2.0 of mpg321. Ported to libao 0.8.0, and implemented remote
control (-R) option for frontends. As well, added compile-time default
setting of audio output device, and other assorted goodies, bug fixes and
introductions. There are bugs in mpg321. I did my best to make things 
generally work, but I would appreciate it if people would test. 
In particular, if you try to seek while using a network stream, I expect 
that mpg321 will just blow up. Version 0.3.0 is my target for 
'network-readiness.' I welcome bug reports and patches.

2001-08-08:
Fixed a wav creation bug. The next release of mpg321 is likely to be a major
feature update, now that most bugs have been ironed out of it.

2001-07-15:
Release 0.1.0 of mpg321. This involved a great refactoring of code, and
is more-or-less a rewrite. mpg321 now uses libmad for decoding, and libao
for all output (not just wave files). It also compiles and works on solaris.
Playlist support is now included in mpg321 as well (Thanks to Tobias 
Bengtsson <tobbe@tobbe.nu> for the first run at this!)

* As of 2001-03-17 (0.0.5), mpg321 should be ready for everyday use. 
* I am currently investigating using libraries other than smpeg for playing
  mp3 files (such as libmad, used in madplayer, and mpg123's own libmpg, 
  which is distributed under the terms of the GPL). This will remove the
  dependency on SDL, which in turn removes a lot of other dependencies; all
  that would have to remain would be libao, for audio output, and the mpeg-
  playing library. This, however, remains to be seen.
