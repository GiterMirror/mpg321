mpg321 was at one point essentially smpeg's 'plaympeg' program, with video 
ripped out and the mpg123 interface grafted on. It has since undergone
large refactorisation and rewriting, but plaympeg is its root.

Thanks to Loki, for funding development of smpeg. mpg321 no longer uses 
smpeg, and Loki no longer exists as a company, but their code lives on.

Thanks especially to Sam Latinga (and everyone in #sdl) for their help
on SDL audio conversion. They made the original wav-file conversion possible!

Thanks to the Xiphophorous company <http://www.xiph.org> and 
Stan Seibert <volsung@asu.edu> for the continued development of libao.

Thanks to Rob Leslie for creating mad and providing continued advice
and code.

Thanks to Red Hat <http://www.redhat.com>, for converting to mpg321 over 
mpg123.
